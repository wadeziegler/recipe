Preparation

1. Pre-heat your oven to 350Â°F.

2. In a medium sized mixing bowl combine the flour, oatmeal, light brown sugar, baking powder, salt and butter until it forms a coarse crumble.

3. In another large mixing bowl combine the apples, butter, flour, corn starch, lemon juice, brown sugar, salt and spices and toss to fully coat the apples. Pour the apple mixture into a 10- by 15-inch baking dish.

4. Fully coat the top of the apple mixture with the crumble topping and bake for 30-40 minutes or until the crumble topping is golden brown and the apples are tender.

5. Allow to cool slightly, then serve warm with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. Or chill overnight and its still delicious cold!
