Preparation

In a large sauce pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil on high heat. Sear the meat for about one minute. Add the onions and garlic and cook for about 3 minutes. Add the 1/4 cup cognac and stir until it evaporates. Turn the heat down to medium and add the tomato paste, beef base, brown sugar, ketchup, and water. Cook about 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

In the meantime, heat the remaining olive oil in a medium skillet set over high heat, until smoking. Add mushrooms and rosemary and cook about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the remaining 1/4 cup cognac. Be careful, since it might flame. Cook for another minute, stirring to deglaze pan.

Add the mushrooms to the steak sauce and fold in the Media Crema. Serve the dish immediately with a side of white rice.
